"""Sprint 3 (visual generation): map every narration scene to an animated
scene archetype.

This is the layer that makes the visual generation a *system* rather than a
set of hand-authored scenes: for each storyboard scene, the LLM picks one of
the closed vocabulary of archetypes in llm.SCENE_ARCHETYPES (each backed by a
self-animating Remotion component) and fills in its text slots, driven by
what the narration actually says plus the OCR text of the slides on screen at
that moment.

Output (scene_visuals.json) is consumed directly by the renderer, so adding a
new archetype means adding one component + one vocabulary entry, never
per-scene code.
